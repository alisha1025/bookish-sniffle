Project Overview
This backend API allows management of an e-commerce store's categories, products, and tags. It uses Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database, and Express.js to handle HTTP requests.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
Sequelize: Promise-based ORM for Node.js to interact with PostgreSQL.
PostgreSQL: Relational database system.
dotenv: Module for loading environment variables from a .env file.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed.
PostgreSQL installed and running.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file based on the .env.EXAMPLE template provided:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.EXAMPLE .env
Update the .env file with your PostgreSQL database credentials:

plaintext
Copy code
DB_NAME='your_database_name'
DB_USER='your_database_user'
DB_PASSWORD='your_database_password'
Configuration
Database Configuration
Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running. Update the .env file with your database credentials. The config/connection.js file uses these credentials to connect to the database.

Database Setup
Create the database using the schema file:
bash
Copy code
psql -U <your-username> -f db/schema.sql
Seeding Data
Run the seed script to populate the database with initial data:
bash
Copy code
npm run seed
Running the Application
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Or, for development with automatic restarts:

bash
Copy code
npm run watch
The server will run on port 3001 by default, or you can set the PORT environment variable.
